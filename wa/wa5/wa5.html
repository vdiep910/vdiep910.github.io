When tested with a screen reader, the page was difficult to navigate.
The layout relied heavily on non-semantic div and font elements, which
made page structure unclear. Headings were not announced properly,
images lacked alternative text, form inputs had no labels, and the

        <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>

        <p>
          By Evan Wild
        </p>

        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud,
          independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like
          the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.
        </p>

        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such
          a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a
          real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of bear</h3>

        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you
          have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another
          species.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears
          are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the countryside.
        </p>

        <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>

        <img src="media/wild-bear.jpg" alt="A wild bear standing in a forest habitat">

        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing
          ingredients.
        </p>

        <img src="media/urban-bear.jpg" alt="An urban bear near city buildings">

        <p>
          Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets
          in McDonalds, to their own apartment.
        </p>
